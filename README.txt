JsUnitTest

Description:
    This JavaScript project provides a one-file JavaScript test suite.

    This is based off unittest.js from "prototypejs":http://prototypejs.org, 
    except this library has no dependency on prototype.js so there is no 
    chance your code-under-test can conflict with prototype.js or that you might 
    accidently use a prototype.js helper for a library that will be deployed 
    independently off prototypejs.
